# Source Document: Connected Systems Strategy

## Document Title
**Connected Systems: Enabling Unified Systems & Processes for AI-First Marketing**

## Purpose
Presenting a new vision for connected systems in the Marketing org. Reacting to headcount reductions, changing the approach from an end-to-end connected workflow in one tool to a system of tools connected in a central command center supporting:
- Prioritization
- Strategy
- Planning
- Production
- Measurement of marketing campaigns

## Current State Assessment

### Key Metrics
- **90% manual processes**
- **52 days per campaign execution time**
- **30 manual inputs** required to start production in Workfront

### Core Problems
1. **Disconnected Tools**: Campaign orchestration, content management, audience platforms, and measurement systems operate in silos
2. **Manual Data Flows**: Teams spend hours moving information between systems
3. **Inconsistent Processes**: Different adoption levels across teams (Website/Email use Workfront, Social partial, Events none)
4. **Layoffs Impact**: Central Marketing Ops team reduced, requiring rethink of approach

### Current Workflow Pain Points
- Marketer creates plans in siloed tool (Quip, M365, Asana)
- Must manually enter 30 inputs into Workfront
- Production teams manually review and copy to channel tools (Optimo, LEGO)
- Manual verification of input correctness
- Creates delays and errors
